# FENIX: Enabling In-Network DNN Inference with FPGA-Enhanced Programmable Switches

FENIX is a hybrid in-network machine learning system designed for efficient, low-latency, and highly accurate network traffic analysis. By performing feature extraction on programmable switch ASICs and accelerating neural network inference with FPGAs, FENIX combines the strengths of both devices to improve intelligence in the network data plane.
