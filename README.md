# FENIX: Enabling In-Network DNN Inference with FPGA-Enhanced Programmable Switches

FENIX is a hybrid in-network machine learning system designed for efficient, low-latency, and highly accurate network traffic analysis. By performing feature extraction on programmable switch ASICs and accelerating neural network inference with FPGAs, FENIX combines the strengths of both devices to improve intelligence in the network data plane.

The system is implemented on a platform integrating Tofino ASIC and ZU19EG FPGA, and evaluated on real-world network traffic datasets. Results show that FENIX achieves microsecond-level inference latency, multi-terabit throughput, and high accuracy on mainstream traffic classification tasks, all with low hardware overhead.
